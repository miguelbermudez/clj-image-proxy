# image-proxy

Image Proxy Service written in Clojure, because I really hate tainted canvas when developing.

## Usage

Still a WIP, but it's an API that returns width, height and data as a base64 string for use
as image data in web pages when your browser starts complaing over _silly_ things like 
cross-browser tainting. 

This is a tool I frequently need while working on web applications not for production use.
I'm also really new to clojure so there are probably MUCH better ways to do this but 
_this is how we learn_...
